Features

Consult LegallyWise AI: Click the Consult LegallyWise AI button at the homepage or the logo located on the navbar. This will take you to a room where you can ask a question and get a response that has come from the data the AI has been trained on. You may also choose a language before you click submit to get a response in a language you feel more comfortable in or have a better understanding.

Explain your Document: This feature can be accessed on the homepage by selecting the 'Explain your Document' button. It will take you to a page that will ask you to upload a pdf file, and you can ask questions specifically after you submit the file. This will also simplify and summarize the document if a user asks it to so they can demistify the legal jargon and know what the uploaded document is about before heading into their meeting with a lawyer. 

Profile: This can be accessed by clicking 'Profile' on the navbar and will take a user to a profile page where they can see the fields they had registered with. 

Contact: This can be accessed by clicking 'Contact' on the navbar and will take the user to a contact page that lists some important contacts they can either send an email to or call to get more legal information. 

About: This can be accessed by clicking 'About' on the navbar and will take the user to a page where the app is explained a little and some information about the team that worked on the project.
